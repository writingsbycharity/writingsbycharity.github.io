                       <p>Voiture</p>
	<p>Mr.Teals lecture about Romeo and Juliet drags on as I watch the red hand go around and around. The other hands inch their way closer to three o’clock, cueing that school would end soon. This meant that in two and a half hours, we have a soccer game against our rivals, the bulldogs. I leaned forward on the edge of my seat, grasping the desk in anticipation for the work to end and fun to begin.</p> 
<p>As I wait for the last minute to pass, I feel a buzz in my pocket. I try to ignore it, reaching into my pocket to send whoever is calling to voicemail. I click a button on the side of the phone to silence the vibrations that are going down my leg. As soon as my hand is out of my pocket and back to gripping the desk, it begins to vibrate again. I reach in my pocket for a second time within 10 seconds, and press the same button on the side of the device that caused it to be silent. I keep my hand in my pocket, preparing to play the action yet again. Instead of buzzing vibrations, a loud ringing came from the announcement speakers in the classroom. As I begin to get out of my seat, my phone begins to vibrate again, causing me to reach into my pocket and look at who has called me three times within a singular minute.</p> 
		<p>Emerson Hanky</p>
	<p>Of course it was her. She relies on me for everything. I deny the call again, hoping she can do problem solving on her own to fix whatever tangled mess she got herself into. I zip my backpack closed, and swing it onto my back as I scurry out of the classroom. As I enter the hallway, my phone begins to buzz in the bottom of my pocket for a fourth time. I reach for my phone, beginning to worry about her. I don’t want mom to get mad at me for not helping her again.</p> 	
<p>I quickly click the green button and answer the phone, “Hello?”</p> 
<p>“I - I need help, I - I don’t know where-e I am.” Emmy says frantically, her usual soft voice, is turned somewhat raspy, shaky, and slurred.</p> 
	<p>“How don’t you know where you are? How’d you get there?” I ask.</p>
	<p>“I don’t remember,” Emmy mumbles; I feel kind of bad for her, clearly she is confused, probably drunk, but confused to say the least.</p> 
<p>“Are you with anyone?”</p> 
<p>“No now,” she says sassily.</p> 
	<p>“Are you drunk?” I asked, having a suspicion since it is one of the first days over 60 degrees since last summer, and since she was having trouble enunciating her words.</p> 
	<p>“No. Not really.” She says, in a manner that feels like she is intentionally trying to aggravate me.</p> 
<p>“Alright, have you been drinking?” I ask.</p> 
<p>“Not really.” She says, aggravating me more, it does not seem logical to say not really, to a yes or no question, that has no gray area.</p> 
<p>“Okay… so if you can’t tell me what’s happening how am I supposed to help?”</p> 
<p>“I need you to come pick me up, I-I don’t know what happened to the car,” She says, slurring her words. I began to panic.</p> 
<p>“What the fuck do you mean you don’t know what happened to the car?!”</p> 
<p>“Don’t yell at me.”</p>
<p>“Are you fucking kidding me, how do you expect me to come get you when you took our car for the day?” I ask, trying to keep my cool.</p> 
<p>“Can Nate drive you?” She asks, referring to my boyfriend.</p> 
<p>“Where are you?” I ask, “I have a game in less than 2 hours, I’m supposed to warm up in thirty minutes.”</p>
<p>“I’m like a ten minute drive from the school,” she says.</p> 
<p>“What street?” I ask.</p> 
<p>“Portage road.”</p> 
<p>“Alright, whatever, I’ll call you when we're on Portage then.” I ran to Nate's car where he was waiting for me, and quickly explained the situation that Emmy got herself into, or at least the version I know. We both quickly got in the car and Nate began driving towards Portage road.</p> 
<p>“I cannot be late, recruiters are coming to see me play tonight.” I say, hoping he speeds up.</p> 
<p>“I know, we won’t be late, do you want me to drop you off so you can warm up and  I’ll go find her by myself to look?” Nate asks, grabbing me by the hand to reassure me.</p> 
<p>“No. It’s fine, she would probably find some way to blame me if I didn’t pick her up.” I say.</p> 
<p>“What would she blame you for?” Nate asks.</p> 
<p>“Whatever mess she is in right now.” </p>
<p>“Well, you have me as an alibi,” he says.</p> 
<p>“She always does this.”</p> 
<p>“Does what?”</p>
<p>“It feels like every time I have something important, she ruins it with some stupid fucking screw up.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I get what you mean, maybe you should just leave it to your parents to deal with.” Nate says.</p> 
<p>“Maybe, my mom would somehow say that it was my fault that she has to help Emmy.”</p> 
<p>“Like when she skipped class last week?” Nate asked, slightly chuckling.</p> 
<p>“Exactly!”</p> 
<p>Nate let out another laugh, “were turning onto Portage road,” he says.</p> 
<p>“Cool.” I say, reaching for my phone that’s buried in my back pocket. I begin to dial Emmy’s number, as I wait for the ring to indicate the call is going through, I am met with a full voicemail box. “Her phone isn’t ringing.” I say, dialing again, met with the same dial tone. I call again, and again, and again, until finally it rings one time, but is quickly met with a dial tone. I call one more time, and she finally answers after two rings.</p> 
<p>“Hello?” she asks, as if she doesn’t have a caller ID.</p> 
<p>“We’re on Portage road, where are you?” I ask.</p> 
<p>“I don’t know.” She replies.</p> 
<p>“Emmy, look around.” I say.</p>
<p>“Dude, I literally don’t know… trees?” She asks.</p> 
<p>“Are you asking if there are trees, or do you see trees?” I ask.</p> 
<p>“I see trees.” She says.</p> 
<p>“Do you see any buildings?” I ask, as I am looking for her on the side of the road, as I watch hundreds of trees pass by.</p> 
<p>“No.”</p> 
<p>“Okay, are there any other descriptors you can try to give me?” I ask “I’m only spending five more minutes looking for you, and then I have to go, I have an important game today.”</p> 
<p>“I don’t know, there's grass, and a fence.” I look around the road side and am left staring at miles of road with no buildings, a fence behind the shallow woods, and lots of grass.</p> 
	<p>“Emerson, I’m gonna freak the fuck out, can you try to figure out where the fuck you are please?”</p> 
	<p>“Yeah. I think I am near 21st street.” </p>
	<p>“That’s another ten minutes down the road, I have a game to go to.” I say, getting frustrated that she still isn’t showing care in my life.</p> 
<p>“Where is she?” Nate interrupts, I turn and look at him, he has a sense of calm to him.</p> 
	<p>“Near 21st street.” I say.</p> 
<p>“I can get us there in like 4 minutes.” Nate says, smirking. I slightly roll my eyes and shake my head.</p> 
	<p>“I’m just going to call mom, she can come pick you up.” I say back to Emmy on the phone.</p> 
	<p>“Perfect, I can tell her how you stranded me.” Emmy says. I fall silent. “I’ll see you in a few.” She says before she hangs up the phone. I leave the phone held to my ear for a second, not wanting to repeat what she just said out loud to Nate. I took a deep breath and closed my phone quickly.</p> 
<p>“What do you want to do?” Nate asks.</p>
	<p>“Let’s just pick her up.”</p> 
	<p>“Are you sure?” He asks, hesitant.</p> 
	<p>“Yeah.” I say, reaching for the radio to turn it up slightly. The car was filled with Britney Spears, as we searched for my lost, bratty, sister.</p> 
	“What changed?” Nate asks over the music.</p> 
	<p>“Nothing, she just confirmed that she will throw me under the bus if I call my mom, so it’s not worth it.”</p> 
	<p>“What do you mean it's not worth it? Recruiters are coming to watch you play!” Nate says.</p> 
	<p>“Yeah, I know, but my mom will pull me out of soccer altogether if I don’t help lookout for Emmy, and if she knows that she skipped school and is lost, and possibly drunk on the side of the road alone, she would definitely pull me from soccer.” I say, beginning to stress my chances of escaping this town and my clingy family. Nate fell silent. I reach for the volume on the radio and turn up the unfamiliar song.</p> 
	<p>After twenty minutes of driving down Portage road, we finally found Emmy. Her peachy skin was red and looked scorching, while it extracted an odor that smells similar to what I would imagine a crowded bathroom at a bar to smell like. 
	<p>“What took so long?” she asks, falling into the back seat. Nate closes the door behind her, and climbs into the driver's seat.</p> 
	<p>“You were a lot further than you said you were.” I say.</p> 
	<p>Emmy scoffs, her eyes lagging to open in response; the indicator to know when she was extra hammered. “I was like five extra minutes down the road.”</p> 
	<p>“No you were not,” Nate says, beginning to drive back towards school.</p> 
<p>“I swear you guys never give me the benefit of the doubt.”</p>
<p>“We’re giving you the benefit of the doubt right now, by picking you up… what happened?” I say, my anger growing as I am already late to warm-ups and we are thirty minutes away.</p> 
	<p>“Literally nothing.” she tries to say as she slurs her words.</p> 
	<p>“Where’s the car?” I ask.</p> 
	<p>“You have it.”</p> 
	<p>“Nope, it’s your day to have it, where’d you go today?” I ask.</p> 
	<p>“You just picked me up. You know where I went,” She drunkenly says.</p> 
	<p>“Just leave her alone, she’s just going to get in your head” Nate whispered to me.</p> 
	<p>“Fuck no.” I say, turning around to look at her “ugh, look look disgusting, what the fuck did you do?”</p> 
	<p>“Nothing, take a chill pill, you need it.”</p> 
	<p>“Where’s our car?” I ask.</p> 
	<p>“I don’t know!” she yells back.</p> 
	<p>“Where did you last drive to?”</p> 
	<p>“Home, yesterday.”</p> 
	<p>“No you didn’t, yesterday I had the car, today was your day.” I say, running the conversation in circles.</p> 
	<p>“I don’t know then.” she says, closing her eyes.</p> 
	<p>“No, like actually this isn’t some fun game, I don’t like the joke, you’re going to forget where you left the car, so fucking tell me.” I say.</p>
	<p>“No, like actually” she says mocking me, “I don’t know where it is.”</p> 
	<p>“So you lost it?”</p> 
	<p>“Yep.”</p> 
	<p>“Are you kidding me?!” Mom is going to kill us!” I say.</p> 
	<p>“She’s going to kill you.” she says, grinning.</p> 
	<p>“Fuck you. I can’t wait until we graduate and you have to deal with the real world for once.” I say in retaliation.</p> 


<p>The remainder of the car ride, I watched as the trees flew by us; watching the clock lose twenty minutes before we finally got back to the school. I quickly got out of the car and ran to my locker in the women's locker room and began changing for the soccer game. I ran through the hallway that had blue and white checkered floors, trying not to slip with my cleats already on. I ran through the door, and onto the soccer field,</p> 
	<p>“Hanky!” My coach yells, I run over to him. “Where were you?” He asks.</p> 
	<p>“Family emergency.” I say, adjusting my hair, and trying to catch my breath from running across the school.</p> 
	<p>“You always have a family emergency,” he says, “should I talk with your parents?”</p> 
	<p>“No.” I say swiftly. </p>
	<p>“Then what’s going on? Is someone dying?” he asks, confusion plastered on his face.</p> 
	<p>“No, my sister just always has something she needs me for.” I say.</p> 
	<p>“This team needs you,” he says, tapping his pen on his clipboard, “we have recruiters here to watch you warm-up and play, and you weren’t even here.”</p> 
	<p>“Sorry, coach.”</p> 
	<p>“Apologies aren’t in order, presence and punctuality are what matter here; your tardiness not only reflects poorly on you as a player, but it reflects poorly on us as a D1 school.”</p> 
	<p>“Yes, coach, it won’t happen again.” I say.</p> 
	<p>“Do you need someone to talk to?” he asks. </p>
	<p>“No, thank you.” I say.</p> 
	<p>“Okay, well if you change your mind, I am here, coach Rylie is here, the school's counselor is here.” he says, offering a smile.</p> 
	<p>“Thank you, coach.” I say in reply, giving a small grin, trying to forget the events leading up to the game.</p> 
	<p>“Since you don’t need anyone to talk to, and no one is dying, make sure you’re not late again” he says “your sister's life is her responsibility, not yours.”</p> 
	<p>“Yes, coach.”</p> 
	<p>“Give me a mile and dynamics before you touch a ball.” he says, walking away.</p> 
	<p>Just before the start of the game, I find my position at the center of the field, lining my ball up for the kick-off. I browse the stands as I await the other teams preparation; men with clipboards sit near the top of the bleachers, I browse some more; my boyfriend and best friend are sitting in the 2nd row, sharing a wave once they see my eyes, I continue to browse the stands; nowhere to be found, my mom, dad, or sister.</p>

						<p>Allumettes</p>
My relationship with my sister has always been one that confuses people. I call her on her birthday, send her gifts, help her financially when she needs it, and have even helped her move across the country a few times; today marks the ninth year in a row that she has yet to mention my birthday. Today we are thirty-five. 
Whenever anybody asks about Emmy, I twinge at the thought of explaining her howabouts or wellbeing. I hesitate to say it, but I am embarrassed of her- for her. Whenever anyone asks about my twin, I am at a loss for words to describe her; because we did have a good childhood, she was a good sister, I think. It’s hard to say, our mom likes to blame me for a lot of her mistakes, but I try not to hold any resentment for Emmy since it wasn’t her fault. This year, I don’t want to call her. I want to see if she calls me, I want to see if she remembers that today isn’t just about her. 
By the time we were seventeen, Emmy had advanced her cigarette addiction to a pack a day. In the midst of the humid summer, just before our senior year of highschool, our mom found out that Emmy was borderline a chain smoker, so she grounded her; which meant that Emmy wasn’t allowed to leave the house unless it was for school… seeing that it was summer, Emmy was housebound. She rarely left anyway though so it didn’t seem to affect her daily activities much. 
Even though our dad put a lock on the beer fridge, Emmy still found a way to crack a cold one by the pool. Most days she would spend hours sitting by the pool with our friends, day drinking while our dad was working, and our mom was running her daily errands to who knows where. I’m not to say that I am a saint in these situations, because I did smoke occasionally, but I had stopped smoking for a few months at this point, and I did, occasionally, day drink with her and our friends; but I knew when to stop. 
In our backyard, a few feet behind the pool, there was a dingy old shed that had two stories: the attic once was a place where we played dress up and read fairy tales. When we were seventeen though, it is where Emmy housed her substances. 
On this particular day, our friend Grace brought Emmy a ridiculous amount of cigarettes, she said her brother got a good deal and needed to get rid of some. Emmy was more than happy to take any spare packs they had lying around. Once she received the ten plus packs of cigarettes, she promptly marched down the steps off of the patio, and to the shed. 
I rarely went into the shed with Emmy, because usually there were a lot of bees, which I am allergic to, and I didn’t necessarily love hotboxing cigarettes; especially when I was able to drive my car down the road and smoke without worrying about my neighbors snitching. Unfortunately, Emmy wasn’t as lucky as I was since she was grounded for the time being. For some reason, on this day I drank enough that hotboxing the shed didn’t sound too bad. I entered the musky, dark, damp environment that smelled as if cigarettes clung to every crease in the wood shafts and the exposed insulation. One by one we climbed up the shaky ladder that led to the short, unstable room that was Emmy’s hideout. The 5 of us crammed in the room that had one small circular window which cracked just enough to let out the smallest bit of smoke. 
Emmy stumbled to find a lighter with the small window being her only source of light. Unable to find a lighter, she asked Hayden, our friend, if she would “run inside and grab a lighter from the drawer next to the slider door.” Hayden reluctantly agreed since she was closest to the ladder and scurried inside. For a moment, while we waited for Hayden to come back, everything felt perfect, it felt carefree, easy. Emmy’s laugh was still so pure, she was so happy. 
When Hayden came back, she yelled “will matches work?!” from underneath us, Emmy’s eyes darted to mine, in a weird, telepathic way, she nonverbally asked if matches would work in the shed, I shrugged my shoulders. 
Emmy yelled back “I guess… were there no lighters?” she asked. 
“No.” Hayden replied, “there weren’t any lighters, I found these next to the fireplace.” 
It hit me, “Emmy!” I yelled “Oh my god! Mom probably smelled the cigarettes in here and found all your lighters and hid them,” I said, laughing up a fit.
 Emmy scoffed and rolled her eyes “we see how well that worked with the beer” she said bringing her can up to tink cans with Chloe. While we were all caught up laughing at the notion of our mom throwing away the lighters, there was a loud bang that shook the whole shed. 
“Ouch…” Hayden said, holding her head, we all continued giggling, “here.” She said handing Emmy the matches. Above our heads, I heard a slight buzz, almost like white noise. 
The moment Emmy struck the match, the buzz got much louder… I couldn’t pinpoint it. Everyone else could seemingly hear it too since they had the same confused expression painted on their faces, looking above our heads. Emmy of course needed a cigarette since she hadn’t had one in a day, so she ignored the sound, just as she brought the match to the cigarette that rested in between her lips to light it, a swarm of bees exploded from the opening in the roof. 
I crawled as fast as I could towards the opening in the ground, but was crushed by Chloe, who was also trying to make a run for it. I could feel the stings piercing through my skin as I tried my best to army crawl forward. As I finally approached the opening, I leaped down, falling on my ass. Emmy jumped down behind me, she grabbed my arm to help me up; bees were swarming us as we stumbled out of the shed. Once we reached the grass, I ran to the above ground pool and scaled the side to reach the chlorinated water that filled my fresh stings. 
I stayed underwater until I felt it was safe, coming up every few seconds for a quick breath of air. I could hear faint screams, and I was itching to know what was going on, if the bees were gone yet, why there was screaming, but I was petrified to get stung anymore, and the water burned my eyes every time I tried to open them. 
Finally, after a minute or two of bobbing for air, I came up and began to wipe my eyes, as I coughed while my lungs were filling with subpar air. Once I opened my eyes I was met with a cloud of smoke, limiting my visibility tremendously. As I looked around, I could hear screams, I didn’t see any bees, all I could see was smoke. 
As I tried not to panic, I frantically yelled for my twin “Emmy!” No reply, “Emmy!” I yelled, climbing out of the pool, “Emmy! Emmy!” I yelled again and again, searching for a response from her. 
“Yeah!” I finally heard her yell from the side of the house near the pool. I ran to the pool deck’s exit point and around the corner of the house, trying to ignore the burning sensation that filled my body. Once I got to the side of the house, I found Emmy talking to our neighbor. 
I asked, “what happened?”
She didn’t have much to say back, “The sheds on fire. Obviously.” 
I turned around and looked at the source of the smoke. What once was our princess tower was being engulfed in flames. I was devastated, and drunk, and my throat was closing, I cried hysterically and fell to the ground as I watched my childhood playhouse disintegrate until I blacked out.

Once I woke up, I was in the hospital with an IV in my arm. I could hear my mom talking to my dad on the other side of the curtain. I looked at my arms and they were covered in what looked like blisters, they hurt, my entire body hurt. I pressed the call button that was placed in my hand, and my mom immediately came through the curtain. 
“You’re awake,” she said. I gave her a faint smile, my dad looked at me with sad eyes as my mom sat on the edge of my bed. “How do you feel?” she asked. 
“Not good,” I replied as I shook my head “am I okay, how many times did I get stung?” 
“Sixteen,” My mom said.
My mind was reminded of the events that happened before I woke up; “Where’s Emmy?” I asked. 
“Don’t worry about her, we will deal with her.” My dad said. I felt so helpless, so ignorant, I had no idea what was going on, I had no idea if the shed was still up, I had no idea if Emmy was okay.
I asked again “what happened to the shed?” and asked if it was gone.
 My mom, seemingly upset, scoffed and crossed her arms “Now doesn't seem like the appropriate time to talk about your punishment for your actions.” she stated. 
“What? I asked, confused on what exactly I did in this situation besides hang out with my sister. “Why would I be punished?” I asked. 
“Don’t act ignorant.” She said, my eyes darted to my fathers hazel eyes that immediately fell to the floor. 
“I’m not. All I did was follow Emmy into the shed.” I said, beginning to feel defeated. 
“You knew that there was a bee infestation in there, and now we have a medical bill on top of the price for car insurance for you two, and now we have to rebuild a shed on top of everything and replace everything that was damaged.” 
I was slightly shocked with the coldness I was greeted with, but it wasn’t too atypical so I didnt question it too much. “Dad told me that the bees were mostly gone, Emmy told me that they were completely gone.” I said, starting to get angry. 
“Whatever, did you just want to smoke cigarettes? Did you think we wouldn't notice?” she asked, getting visibly upset. 
“No, I don’t smoke cigarettes.” I said “Emmy wanted to go up there, and I wanted to hang out with my friends who were following her, so I went too, that’s it.” 
“So then, why would you entice Emmy to smoke cigarettes in the shed? I want to know right now what the hell was going through your head when you lit a match in the shed?! You know she has a problem and needs to quit smoking! Why would you encourage her to smoke, in a confined area? What did you guys think was going to happen? Did you think that sprinklers were going to go off if the wooden building you were in caught fire? Like, seriously, did you even think?” She asked, working up quite the fit. 
“Okay. Sorry for being stupid.” I said, complying with her skewed praise of her children. “So, is the shed gone then?” I asked. She glared at me and turned her back, walking away from me in a rage. 
“It’s gone.” my dad said before going after my mom. 
Once the doctors came in to see me, they gave me a prescription for an epipen, showing shock that I did not already have one, stating that it is detrimental to have one on hand, and that I am lucky the paramedics showed up when they did. 

About 5 hours later, I was finally able to go home, where my sister was still grounded, watching TV as if nothing happened. Sure, she had some bee stings on her, but she wasn’t allergic like I was, she didn't react like I did, she wasn't in pain like I was. 
My mom walked into the house behind me announcing the “family meeting!” which consisted of the four of us. I plopped myself on the couch, mentally preparing myself for the meeting that would determine my summer plans.
“So, how was everyone’s day?” My mom sarcastically asked, which was followed by dead silence. 
“So, what were you guys thinking?” My dad asked. Emmy shrugged her shoulders, I was frozen, I didn't know what to say or do. 
“I don’t know what you could have possibly been thinking,” our mom said, staring me down. 
“Me? Or us?” I asked plainly. 
“You.” She said “I have asked you endlessly to keep an eye out for your sister, and you continue to disappoint me.” 
My heart dropped to my ass, I don’t understand why it has to be my responsibility to look after my twin, we're the same age, and she is just as competent as me. “Why is this my fault?” I asked. 
My dad laughed, as if I should have already known what I did wrong.
“Who’s the grounded one?” my mom asked with a condescending tone shining through. 
“Me.” Emmy said, raising her hand. 
“How would Emmy get cigarettes; how would she get beer?” my mom asked. 
I stared at her for a minute, debating on telling her that I wasn’t the one that gave her the cigarettes or beer; my eyes met Emmys, who distinctly said not to tell her Chloe brought the cigarettes. “I don’t know, maybe you should ask her.” I said as my best defense to keep Emmy happy with me, and to try to get my mom off my ass. 
My dad interrupted, “where’d you get the cigarettes, Emmy?”
“I would assume that they came from a store… maybe a gas station…” she said back. My dad looked at me with a frazzled look on his face. 
My mom seemed to have enough at this point and said “Whatever, Emmy you’re grounded for the rest of the summer, maybe even into the fall,” she made eye contact with me, “you’re grounded until the end of summer too.” 
            I was baffled, “What, how does that make sense!?” I asked, “Emmy was already grounded for half the summer, she only gets a month, and a half added but I get 3 whole months?” 
            My mom scoffed and let out a little laugh, “yeah, well you probably shouldn’t play with fire.” she said. 
            “I’m not even the one that lit the match!” I fought. 
            “Do you want both of you to be grounded until winter break? Because that is what it’s sounding like” my mom asked with the same condescending tone radiating through each word. 
            I shook my head silently, and leaned back into the couch, feeling every sting piercing through my skin as my back meets the couch cushion. I again, accepted that I was being punished for Emmy’s actions.
