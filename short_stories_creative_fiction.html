                       <p>Voiture</p>
	<p>Mr.Teals lecture about Romeo and Juliet drags on as I watch the red hand go around and around. The other hands inch their way closer to three o’clock, cueing that school would end soon. This meant that in two and a half hours, we have a soccer game against our rivals, the bulldogs. I leaned forward on the edge of my seat, grasping the desk in anticipation for the work to end and fun to begin.</p> 
<p>As I wait for the last minute to pass, I feel a buzz in my pocket. I try to ignore it, reaching into my pocket to send whoever is calling to voicemail. I click a button on the side of the phone to silence the vibrations that are going down my leg. As soon as my hand is out of my pocket and back to gripping the desk, it begins to vibrate again. I reach in my pocket for a second time within 10 seconds, and press the same button on the side of the device that caused it to be silent. I keep my hand in my pocket, preparing to play the action yet again. Instead of buzzing vibrations, a loud ringing came from the announcement speakers in the classroom. As I begin to get out of my seat, my phone begins to vibrate again, causing me to reach into my pocket and look at who has called me three times within a singular minute.</p> 
		<p>Emerson Hanky</p>
	<p>Of course it was her. She relies on me for everything. I deny the call again, hoping she can do problem solving on her own to fix whatever tangled mess she got herself into. I zip my backpack closed, and swing it onto my back as I scurry out of the classroom. As I enter the hallway, my phone begins to buzz in the bottom of my pocket for a fourth time. I reach for my phone, beginning to worry about her. I don’t want mom to get mad at me for not helping her again.</p> 	
<p>I quickly click the green button and answer the phone, “Hello?”</p> 
<p>“I - I need help, I - I don’t know where-e I am.” Emmy says frantically, her usual soft voice, is turned somewhat raspy, shaky, and slurred.</p> 
	<p>“How don’t you know where you are? How’d you get there?” I ask.</p>
	<p>“I don’t remember,” Emmy mumbles; I feel kind of bad for her, clearly she is confused, probably drunk, but confused to say the least.</p> 
<p>“Are you with anyone?”</p> 
<p>“No now,” she says sassily.</p> 
	<p>“Are you drunk?” I asked, having a suspicion since it is one of the first days over 60 degrees since last summer, and since she was having trouble enunciating her words.</p> 
	<p>“No. Not really.” She says, in a manner that feels like she is intentionally trying to aggravate me.</p> 
<p>“Alright, have you been drinking?” I ask.</p> 
<p>“Not really.” She says, aggravating me more, it does not seem logical to say not really, to a yes or no question, that has no gray area.</p> 
<p>“Okay… so if you can’t tell me what’s happening how am I supposed to help?”</p> 
<p>“I need you to come pick me up, I-I don’t know what happened to the car,” She says, slurring her words. I began to panic.</p> 
<p>“What the fuck do you mean you don’t know what happened to the car?!”</p> 
<p>“Don’t yell at me.”</p>
<p>“Are you fucking kidding me, how do you expect me to come get you when you took our car for the day?” I ask, trying to keep my cool.</p> 
<p>“Can Nate drive you?” She asks, referring to my boyfriend.</p> 
<p>“Where are you?” I ask, “I have a game in less than 2 hours, I’m supposed to warm up in thirty minutes.”</p>
<p>“I’m like a ten minute drive from the school,” she says.</p> 
<p>“What street?” I ask.</p> 
<p>“Portage road.”</p> 
<p>“Alright, whatever, I’ll call you when we're on Portage then.” I ran to Nate's car where he was waiting for me, and quickly explained the situation that Emmy got herself into, or at least the version I know. We both quickly got in the car and Nate began driving towards Portage road.</p> 
<p>“I cannot be late, recruiters are coming to see me play tonight.” I say, hoping he speeds up.</p> 
<p>“I know, we won’t be late, do you want me to drop you off so you can warm up and  I’ll go find her by myself to look?” Nate asks, grabbing me by the hand to reassure me.</p> 
<p>“No. It’s fine, she would probably find some way to blame me if I didn’t pick her up.” I say.</p> 
<p>“What would she blame you for?” Nate asks.</p> 
<p>“Whatever mess she is in right now.” </p>
<p>“Well, you have me as an alibi,” he says.</p> 
<p>“She always does this.”</p> 
<p>“Does what?”</p>
<p>“It feels like every time I have something important, she ruins it with some stupid fucking screw up.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I get what you mean, maybe you should just leave it to your parents to deal with.” Nate says.</p> 
<p>“Maybe, my mom would somehow say that it was my fault that she has to help Emmy.”</p> 
<p>“Like when she skipped class last week?” Nate asked, slightly chuckling.</p> 
<p>“Exactly!”</p> 
<p>Nate let out another laugh, “were turning onto Portage road,” he says.</p> 
<p>“Cool.” I say, reaching for my phone that’s buried in my back pocket. I begin to dial Emmy’s number, as I wait for the ring to indicate the call is going through, I am met with a full voicemail box. “Her phone isn’t ringing.” I say, dialing again, met with the same dial tone. I call again, and again, and again, until finally it rings one time, but is quickly met with a dial tone. I call one more time, and she finally answers after two rings.</p> 
<p>“Hello?” she asks, as if she doesn’t have a caller ID.</p> 
<p>“We’re on Portage road, where are you?” I ask.</p> 
<p>“I don’t know.” She replies.</p> 
<p>“Emmy, look around.” I say.</p>
<p>“Dude, I literally don’t know… trees?” She asks.</p> 
<p>“Are you asking if there are trees, or do you see trees?” I ask.</p> 
<p>“I see trees.” She says.</p> 
<p>“Do you see any buildings?” I ask, as I am looking for her on the side of the road, as I watch hundreds of trees pass by.</p> 
<p>“No.”</p> 
<p>“Okay, are there any other descriptors you can try to give me?” I ask “I’m only spending five more minutes looking for you, and then I have to go, I have an important game today.”</p> 
<p>“I don’t know, there's grass, and a fence.” I look around the road side and am left staring at miles of road with no buildings, a fence behind the shallow woods, and lots of grass.</p> 
	<p>“Emerson, I’m gonna freak the fuck out, can you try to figure out where the fuck you are please?”</p> 
	<p>“Yeah. I think I am near 21st street.” </p>
	<p>“That’s another ten minutes down the road, I have a game to go to.” I say, getting frustrated that she still isn’t showing care in my life.</p> 
<p>“Where is she?” Nate interrupts, I turn and look at him, he has a sense of calm to him.</p> 
	<p>“Near 21st street.” I say.</p> 
<p>“I can get us there in like 4 minutes.” Nate says, smirking. I slightly roll my eyes and shake my head.</p> 
	<p>“I’m just going to call mom, she can come pick you up.” I say back to Emmy on the phone.</p> 
	<p>“Perfect, I can tell her how you stranded me.” Emmy says. I fall silent. “I’ll see you in a few.” She says before she hangs up the phone. I leave the phone held to my ear for a second, not wanting to repeat what she just said out loud to Nate. I took a deep breath and closed my phone quickly.</p> 
<p>“What do you want to do?” Nate asks.</p>
	<p>“Let’s just pick her up.”</p> 
	<p>“Are you sure?” He asks, hesitant.</p> 
	<p>“Yeah.” I say, reaching for the radio to turn it up slightly. The car was filled with Britney Spears, as we searched for my lost, bratty, sister.</p> 
	“What changed?” Nate asks over the music.</p> 
	<p>“Nothing, she just confirmed that she will throw me under the bus if I call my mom, so it’s not worth it.”</p> 
	<p>“What do you mean it's not worth it? Recruiters are coming to watch you play!” Nate says.</p> 
	<p>“Yeah, I know, but my mom will pull me out of soccer altogether if I don’t help lookout for Emmy, and if she knows that she skipped school and is lost, and possibly drunk on the side of the road alone, she would definitely pull me from soccer.” I say, beginning to stress my chances of escaping this town and my clingy family. Nate fell silent. I reach for the volume on the radio and turn up the unfamiliar song.</p> 
	<p>After twenty minutes of driving down Portage road, we finally found Emmy. Her peachy skin was red and looked scorching, while it extracted an odor that smells similar to what I would imagine a crowded bathroom at a bar to smell like. 
	<p>“What took so long?” she asks, falling into the back seat. Nate closes the door behind her, and climbs into the driver's seat.</p> 
	<p>“You were a lot further than you said you were.” I say.</p> 
	<p>Emmy scoffs, her eyes lagging to open in response; the indicator to know when she was extra hammered. “I was like five extra minutes down the road.”</p> 
	<p>“No you were not,” Nate says, beginning to drive back towards school.</p> 
<p>“I swear you guys never give me the benefit of the doubt.”</p>
<p>“We’re giving you the benefit of the doubt right now, by picking you up… what happened?” I say, my anger growing as I am already late to warm-ups and we are thirty minutes away.</p> 
	<p>“Literally nothing.” she tries to say as she slurs her words.</p> 
	<p>“Where’s the car?” I ask.</p> 
	<p>“You have it.”</p> 
	<p>“Nope, it’s your day to have it, where’d you go today?” I ask.</p> 
	<p>“You just picked me up. You know where I went,” She drunkenly says.</p> 
	<p>“Just leave her alone, she’s just going to get in your head” Nate whispered to me.</p> 
	<p>“Fuck no.” I say, turning around to look at her “ugh, look look disgusting, what the fuck did you do?”</p> 
	<p>“Nothing, take a chill pill, you need it.”</p> 
	<p>“Where’s our car?” I ask.</p> 
	<p>“I don’t know!” she yells back.</p> 
	<p>“Where did you last drive to?”</p> 
	<p>“Home, yesterday.”</p> 
	<p>“No you didn’t, yesterday I had the car, today was your day.” I say, running the conversation in circles.</p> 
	<p>“I don’t know then.” she says, closing her eyes.</p> 
	<p>“No, like actually this isn’t some fun game, I don’t like the joke, you’re going to forget where you left the car, so fucking tell me.” I say.</p>
	<p>“No, like actually” she says mocking me, “I don’t know where it is.”</p> 
	<p>“So you lost it?”</p> 
	<p>“Yep.”</p> 
	<p>“Are you kidding me?!” Mom is going to kill us!” I say.</p> 
	<p>“She’s going to kill you.” she says, grinning.</p> 
	<p>“Fuck you. I can’t wait until we graduate and you have to deal with the real world for once.” I say in retaliation.</p> 


<p>The remainder of the car ride, I watched as the trees flew by us; watching the clock lose twenty minutes before we finally got back to the school. I quickly got out of the car and ran to my locker in the women's locker room and began changing for the soccer game. I ran through the hallway that had blue and white checkered floors, trying not to slip with my cleats already on. I ran through the door, and onto the soccer field,</p> 
	<p>“Hanky!” My coach yells, I run over to him. “Where were you?” He asks.</p> 
	<p>“Family emergency.” I say, adjusting my hair, and trying to catch my breath from running across the school.</p> 
	<p>“You always have a family emergency,” he says, “should I talk with your parents?”</p> 
	<p>“No.” I say swiftly. </p>
	<p>“Then what’s going on? Is someone dying?” he asks, confusion plastered on his face.</p> 
	<p>“No, my sister just always has something she needs me for.” I say.</p> 
	<p>“This team needs you,” he says, tapping his pen on his clipboard, “we have recruiters here to watch you warm-up and play, and you weren’t even here.”</p> 
	<p>“Sorry, coach.”</p> 
	<p>“Apologies aren’t in order, presence and punctuality are what matter here; your tardiness not only reflects poorly on you as a player, but it reflects poorly on us as a D1 school.”</p> 
	<p>“Yes, coach, it won’t happen again.” I say.</p> 
	<p>“Do you need someone to talk to?” he asks. </p>
	<p>“No, thank you.” I say.</p> 
	<p>“Okay, well if you change your mind, I am here, coach Rylie is here, the school's counselor is here.” he says, offering a smile.</p> 
	<p>“Thank you, coach.” I say in reply, giving a small grin, trying to forget the events leading up to the game.</p> 
	<p>“Since you don’t need anyone to talk to, and no one is dying, make sure you’re not late again” he says “your sister's life is her responsibility, not yours.”</p> 
	<p>“Yes, coach.”</p> 
	<p>“Give me a mile and dynamics before you touch a ball.” he says, walking away.</p> 
	<p>Just before the start of the game, I find my position at the center of the field, lining my ball up for the kick-off. I browse the stands as I await the other teams preparation; men with clipboards sit near the top of the bleachers, I browse some more; my boyfriend and best friend are sitting in the 2nd row, sharing a wave once they see my eyes, I continue to browse the stands; nowhere to be found, my mom, dad, or sister.</p>
