Opportunities 
Serena topples out of bed and melts onto the floor as the sunlight soaks through the broken blinds, hitting her right in the eyes. She squirms and covers her face, rubbing her tired eyes awake. 
“Serena! We have to go soon!” Andrew begins getting more annoyed each time he reminds Serena that she has to get ready; this is his fourth time telling her they need to leave. Serena however is a 22 -year-old college student that works 30 hours a week; she needs to enjoy the extra few minutes of rest she can get before having to endure the company of her family for the next week and a half. 
Andrew loads all their bags into the car and is ‘patiently’ waiting for Serena to get out of bed and get ready. Andrew and Serena have been dating for about 2 years now, they met Sophomore year of highschool but only started dating sophomore year of college. They are comfortable with each other on a level that neither of them had experienced with anyone else; it feels like a love that is unmatchable. Once Serena is ready, the couple finally hit the road for their two hour drive to Serena and Andrew’s home town. They are on winter vacation and decided to save money and spend it with their families instead of going on vacation like their classmates. 
	“So, I applied to a job in San Francisco and have an interview with them on Monday” Andrew said somewhat excited “They’re hiring software developers for roughly $120,000” 
	“That’s cool,” Serena says as she blankly stares out the window of the moving car. 
	“Well kind of… only if you come with… would you want to move to California with me?” 
	“No Andrew, it’s important that I live close to family” 
	“Since when? In highschool you used to always talk about moving away from family and away from the east coast” 
	“Yeah, well when I was 17 and planning my life I didn’t think about the logistics of how difficult it would be to have a kid, or even a pet without any family close by to support us” 
	“Okay but we're not planning on having any kids or pets anytime soon, so why can’t you just compromise and move for a year or two and when the time comes that we’re ready to settle down we can move back”
	“I don’t know Andrew, I just don’t think that it’s practical to move our whole life across the country, and then… move back? I feel like if I begin to make a compromise it’s easy to say you’ll move back when the time comes, but I just don’t think that it will happen.” Serena began growing nauseous in the car. She knows that she is coming across kind of bitchy but she needs this conversation to end. Serena used to hate Virginia, but since going to college she grew a love for her home state and does not have any interest in leaving Virginia. 
	“I understand what you’re saying and I think it would be smart to live near family once we begin to build a family of our own, but since that’s not happening now… I don’t see an issue” 
	“The issue is that I don’t want my family missing out on monumental moments of my life. I want them to be a part of it. It's not just about my family being able to watch a pet or kid if we have one, it's about my family being there from the beginning to the end.” 
	“Okay, well I haven’t gotten any offers, but I do not really want to stay in Virgina, I want to explore before I settle down. I thought you did too” Andrew said, dropping the conversation at that. He is disappointed with Serena’s response to moving out of state with him, but he understands where she is coming from. She’s an only child and it’s important for her family to be a part of any major life choices. Serena grew silent, and focused on the cars around them. 
			    __________
	The couple's first stop is Serena’s family’s home, the couple always stays there when they are visiting town since Andrew’s house is filled with his little siblings. 
Shortly after arriving, Serena goes to her hometown best friend's house, Savannah. They spent their time updating each other on their lives. She left Andrew at her parents house while he had to finish his last exam of the semester. They were planning on eating dinner with his family, so he said he would pick Serena up around 5:00 from Savannah’s. Serena was still feeling nauseous even though it had been hours since her car ride. She is listening to Savannah rant about her co-workers - she mentions that one of her co-workers is pregnant and she couldn’t help but gasp. 
“What?” Savannah asks, very confused.  
	“I’m sorry… I need to tell you something though” Serena says 
	“Okay…” Savannah says eager to hear her information 
	“Okay so… you can not tell ANYONE” Serena says 
	“Uhh… I won't. When have I ever told anyone else something you’ve told me?” 
	“Ok true, so… I think I might be pregnant” Serena grows blush in the face, and is trying her best not to cry. 
	“What?! For real?” Serena nods her head slowly as her face falls into the palms of her hands. 
“No way, have you taken a test yet?” Serena shakes her head. “Okay, well let’s go get one and find out.” The girls leave Savannah’s house and begin walking down the street towards the nearest drug store. 
			----------
	“So what’s the plan?” Serena's mom asks Andrew 
	“Serena is at Savannah’s right now, she is going to hang out with her for a few hours. I'm going to pick her up around 5:00 and we're going to go out and have a picnic and watch the sunset, and that's when I am planning on proposing. Before I leave I’m going to decorate the place and get the confetti cannons ready for everyone to pop when we come in. My family, and our friends will be here around 6:30 just because I am not sure what time we will be done, is that okay?” Stephanie, Serena's mom, is staring at Andrew with tears forming in her eyes. 
	“Sounds amazing Andrew, I am glad that Serena has found someone as thoughtful as you to spend the rest of her life with” 
	“Thank you, hopefully she thinks the same and says yes” Andrew says letting out a chuckle. 
	“She’d be crazy not to say yes” Ron, Serena’s dad, says, patting Andrew on the back. 
			----------
	Serena and Savannah are now in the drug store bathroom, Serena is peeing on a pregnancy test. 
	“So, what are you going to do if it’s positive?” Savannah asks 
	“I have no idea, I don’t feel ready for a baby, but I am graduating in a few months so would it really be that big of a deal if I do have a baby?” Serena debates in her mind the different options she may have.
	“I mean you’re definitely at a point in your life where it is socially acceptable to have a baby, but are you and Andrew ready for that?”
“I don’t know, especially because he wants to move out of Virginia so bad, that’s what I was saying earlier I just don’t know if were going to make it through this part of our lives; he wants more, he wants to explore before settling down, so what is he going to do when he is forced tied down” Serena says, clearly in distress. 
“Well, I will support you however you need me to… if it’s positive” Savannah says giggling. The girls wait the full five minutes for the results of the test. “Flip it over” 
“No, I’m too scared, you read it first” Serena says. Savannah grabs the white stick and blue off of the counter and her jaw instantly drops. “What? What is it?” Serena asks, grabbing the stick from Savannah’s hand. 
Silence, as the girls stare at the results. 
			----------
Andrew makes it to Savannah’s at 4:45, he walks up to the front door and knocks, waiting for a reply. After a few more knocks and a few more minutes, he decides to pull out his phone to look at Serena's location just to make sure they were at Savannah’s.
“Hey” Serena says from behind Andrew, just as he was about to open the app to find her location. 
“Oh, hey” Andrew says looking behind him, watching Serena and Savannah walk up the driveway. “Where did you guys go?” he asks 
“Oh you know, just here and there” Savannah says 
“Oh really specific, thanks for the location update” he says laughing. Serena feels bad for not telling him where she went, but it would stress him out if he knew that she was having a pregnancy scare. 
 Serena and Andrew made their way to the car, leaving Savannah at her house. Serena does not really pay any attention to where they are heading, she has her nose in her phone and is giving Andrew limited attention. When Andrew puts the car in park is when Serena really realizes where they are at, her favorite lookout point to watch the sunset. She is smiling ear to ear and as Andrew opens her car door for her to get out. She goes straight to the park bench that she and Andrew claimed as their own a few years ago, and watches the clouds as their colors slowly change. She glances behind her to see why Andrew isn’t next to her. He is carrying a picnic basket. 
	“What? I thought we were having dinner at your parents” Serena says to Andrew 
	“Something like that” he says, still walking towards her. He begins setting the picnic up, checking his phone every few minutes. Serena takes a deep breath and sits on the picnic blanket as Andrew keeps pulling out different cheeses and crackers to snack on. She can tell that Andrew is nervous, the way that he keeps checking his phone and looking over his shoulder. He finally relaxes and sits next to Serena, snacking and watching the sunset with her. They continue some casual conversation as they normally do, until Andrew starts talking about when he first fell in love with Serena. 
	“Falling in love with you has been the best experience of my life, but watching you fall in love with me has been life changing. The way you used to look at me when we were friends, and the way you look at me now is incomparable. Serena, I love you so much, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you” He gets down on one knee in front of Serena, she throws her hands over her mouth that drops wide open due to shock. “I know we have had our differences with what exactly we want to do once we graduate, all I know is that as long as I am with you, I am happy. Serena Marie Dell, I can not imagine my life without you, will you marry me?” Serena begins crying, she nods her head, 
	“Yes.” she says, in slight disbelief. Andrew grabbed Serena’s hand and put the ring on her ring finger, she hugs and kisses her now fiancé. They have a moment of silence between the two of them as they watch the sunset, but Serena decides she needs to tell Andrew the news.
	“I’m pregnant,” she says, breaking the silence. Andrew tilts his head in disbelief, 
	“You’re what?” he asks 
	“Um, I am… pregnant” Andrew lays down on the blanket and stares at the clouds for a second. “Can you say something?” Serena asks. Andrew sits up and looks at his Finacée’s eyes, a grin begins forming on his face as he stands up. He reaches his hands out and helps Serena up - 
	“I am so excited to have a baby with you” he says, he grabs her body and gives her a hug of reassurance. “It’s a lot to process, and I'm sure it isn’t going to be easy, but I think the timing is meant to be.” In that moment Serena feels at peace; even though she doesn't have any idea where she is going to be in a few months, she knows that in nine, her fiancé and her will be with their baby. 
			----------
	Andrew and Serena go back to Serena’s parents house, Andrew says he forgot something that he needs to give his mom. The couple walks through the front door; Serena almost falls back when all the confetti cannons go off at once. She lets out a squeal as Andrew grabs her hand to keep her from falling. 
	“CONGRATULATIONS!”  Once the initial shock of the loud noises left, Serena is overwhelmed with the amount of friends and family in her parents home. 
	“What is going on?” she asks, and everyone laughs
	“She didn’t say no did she?” Ron asks letting out a laugh 
	“I said yes!” Serena yells finally understanding why everyone was at their house. 
	“And…” Andrew says loud enough for everyone to hear “We’re having a baby!” A few people screamed, most just clapped and cheered for the happy couple. Serena wasn’t expecting Andrew to tell everyone that she was pregnant, but it gave her even more reassurance that everything is going to work out.
