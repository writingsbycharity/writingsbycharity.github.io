</p>Freedom </p>
	<p>The summer after the pandemic, in 2021, I decided I needed to be released from my hometown to begin to explore the state that I have lived in my entire life. Somehow I ended up working at a fudge shop, with no air conditioning, for minimum wage, that smelled like actual shit on Mackinac Island. If you’re not familiar with Mackinac Island, it’s one of those weird places where they pretend we aren’t living in the 21st century. The Island can be found between the upper and lower peninsula of Michigan, where cars don't exist, and where horses, bikes, and boats are everybody's means of transportation.</p> 
	<p>Fudge: A delicacy that was created on marble slabs during the Victorian Era, when tourists began indulging in sweets while vacationing, Mackinac became famous for its fudge making ways when one of the original fudge shops on the Island created the delicacy on a marble slab while allowing tourists to view the making process for free – creating the ultimate tourist trap. </p>
<p>My apartment complex was located in Mackinaw City, stuffed with Island workers who commuted via ferry daily. However, this is unlike many island workers' experience; most seasonal employees that work on Mackinac Island, also live on the Island, the downside of that being, most employers do not pay for a computer pass so employees tend to end up stuck on the Island for the entirety of the summer; shopping for groceries at the singular overpriced grocery store that has limited options, or begging workers that live off Island to bring them decent priced groceries. Similar to those who seasonally live and work on the island; my roommate, Mimi, and I shared a one bedroom apartment – as an only child that had never had shared any space, it was an adjustment to get used to, but surprisingly easy to adjust to. We both had a few coworkers that lived within the apartment complex, filling the majority of our free time with their presence.</p> 
	 <p>Once I began my job at May’s Candy Shop, one of many fudge shops on the island, I quickly found out that the smell of Fudge makes me nauseous, but that Northern Michigan in the summer is one of my favorite places to be. My job was awful, and my boss was the most dawkward person I have ever met to this day; she never looked me in the eyes, and would leave lists of tasks to do rather than ever speaking to me; she gave all three of her employees (including me) a pamphlet at the beginning of the summer that gave a run down on May’s Candy Shop and the history of it. The pamphlet grazed over the fact that Heather is the complete owner of May’s, after the death of her father in 2018, and goes over how May’s “made fudge famous.”</p>
<p>May’s Candy Shop: “The family that made fudge famous started in 1881 in Atchison, Kansas. The family slowly migrated up to Mackinac Island, Michigan. In the 1940s when our country was going through WWII and was still in a depression, the US had to go through sugar rationing to keep food supplies available to all. Since we couldn’t buy all the sugar we wanted, we could only make a certain amount each day. Harold May decided to only make fudge in the mornings and open the stores at noon every day, selling only 1 lb of fudge per customer. Because people loved our high quality fudge, and our dedication to keeping our business open for them all summer long, customers lined up outside for their share of fudge and we would sell out in two hours! Finally, when WWII ended and the US was coming out of the depression, people remembered what we did to keep our fudge fresh and available to them, which is how the May family made fudge famous!”</p>
<p>My two coworkers consisted of Katie and Adena; Katie lived off the Island in the same apartment complex as me, but Adena lived on the Island all year round. Most of my shifts were filled with Adena’s chatter about her husband, plants, and cats. Occasionally, I would wander back into the kitchen, or the fudge slabs and I would chat with Katie, but usually the smell of the fudge put me in the bathroom hovering over the toilet any free moment I got. </p>
	<p>My summer began to become pretty repetitive, I practically did the same thing everyday; wake up, get ready, walk to the ferry, ride the ferry for 25 minutes, go to work, listen to Adena for 6+ hours, sell overpriced fudge, get off of work, ride the ferry, walk home, eat dinner, get ready for bed, go to sleep, and repeat. Even though repetition is typically associated with negativity, I enjoyed my routine, and my friends.</p> 
<p>On this particular day, It was Tuesday, meaning the next day was my only day off; after torturing myself at work all day trying not to yack, I finally walked onto Main Street after my shift with Katie; we quickly weaved through tourists, making our way to the dock to catch the only ferry off the island for the next hour. We walk past the line for Shepler’s that begins just before May’s Fudge, hundreds of tourists wait for the ferry to arrive to take them back to reality. I felt bad for them, since Katie and I were commuters we got to wait in a special line that usually has a maximum of 10 people in it – no matter how long the line is, commuters always get let on the ferry first, mimicking some kind of ‘fast-pass’ system that aggravates the tourists that pay for regular priced tickets.</p>
<p>Katie and I were relieved that we didn’t get stuck on a ‘Mighty Mac’ tour, like we do every morning. The Ferry ride back to reality usually wasn’t too bad, it was about 15-20 minutes, with a beautiful view; but the Ferry ride away from reality, and to the Island, often ended up being around 30 minutes due to the ‘Mighty Mac’ ferry tour that goes under the Mackinac Bridge before going to Mackinac Island. The tour is really cool – the first few times – the captain has roughly a 5 minute speech with some kind of information regarding the bridge as we go under it. After sitting through the tour and listening to the information every morning, it became more of a time waster than a relaxing ride to work - especially since the intercom that the captain uses is extremely loud and interrupts whatever I may be doing. Katie and I burned riding the ferry together into our daily routines, and whenever one of us had a day off, it threw us both off.</p> 
<p>After arriving back to reality, Katie and I finished our routine by taking the 10 minute walk to our apartment from the ferry dock together where Mimi was waiting for me once I arrived home.</p>
<p>“Get ready, we’re going to a party in an hour.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” I said, confused.
<p>“The Shepler boys are having a party, Sonia invited us.” Sonia works with Mimi at Lucky Bean Coffee, May’s Candy’s sister store – owned by Heather's older sister - rumor is that Heather's sister was supposed to take over the family business after the passing of their dad, but it seems that her coffee shop was much more successful than the fudge shop, and she wanted to distance herself so she didn’t receive a bad reputation like the fudge shop. This would have been Sonia’s 3rd year working on the Island as a seasonal worker; she found the job due to her boyfriend working at Shepler's Mackinac Island Ferry, whose staff was throwing the party we were about to attend. Sheplers is one of the only other companies that provides housing for their employees in Mackinaw City, since they have to dock the boats in the city every night.</p> 
<p>When arriving at the party, we were invited into the white, two-story house located directly off of the Mackinaw City Sheplers ferry dock. The boy’s that consisted of the staff at Sheplers call the white house “the beach house,” the outside looks pretty nice, but once we got inside it looked completely different with the oddest layout that I still don’t quite understand. Old oak and tile floors that clash between the living room, entryway and kitchen have a sticky layer that makes it somewhat difficult to move if you stand in one spot for too long. The kitchen counters had red and blue stains in their gray/white pores, and the oak cabinets were missing some door faces here and there. The living room, where we spent most of our night, had a grungy rug that was harder than the wood floors in some spots, and two old couches that were pushed together as if it was a sectional, yet the two couches were different colors with different stains scattered. As Mimi’s social nature allows her to collect everyone’s snapchats, I sat on the tan couch that had less stains than the blue couch, and listened to Sonia’s boyfriend, Josh, and his friend Connor play the guitar while conversing with Sonia. Everyone at the party seemed to work for Sheplers except Mimi, Sonia and I. As I was looking around the room, I noticed a tall, tan guy from across the room with a Shepler’s hat on, he was conversing with some older guy with the same hat on. While examining him, he looked over at me making eye contact, I immediately felt my face grow with redness.</p> 
<p>Why would you stare at him, he probably thinks you’re weird.</p> 
<p>The tall man began walking in the general direction of Sonia and I, and sat on the other side of me once he arrived.</p>
<p>“Hey.” he said to both of us.</p> 
<p>“Hey!” Sonia said, getting pulled out of her conversation with someone that was sitting on the other side of her. “How have you been?” she asks, obviously knowing him prior to this moment.</p>
<p>“Oh, just living the nightmare” he stated, getting a laugh out of both of us.</p> 
<p>“Oh! By the way this is -” Sonia began to say, I think trying to introduce myself, but got cut off by the music that abruptly stopped. Unable to do anything but watch the men as they make a spectacle out of themselves, huddling up. Connor yelling from the huddle soon after it was formed,</p> 
<p>“Fireworks outside, now!” The party quickly gathered outside as the group of 15-20 men began huddling yet again, in the rain, maybe 15 feet away from everyone else towards the lake, with a singular flashlight and 3 lighters. As the men were trying to light the fireworks in the rain, the mysterious man that was sitting next to Sonia and I, arrived outside and quickly diffused the situation, sending everyone back inside.</p> 
	<p>“- but why can’t we set off fireworks” Connor asks the somewhat responsible man that vetoed the fun.</p> 
	<p>“Because, you already had the cops come yesterday for lighting fireworks off.”</p>
<p>“We need to find a ride home,” Mimi whispered in my ear as I was trying to eavesdrop.</p>  
<p>“What why?” I asked, confused since we walked to and from Sheplers at least twice a day, and we both enjoyed the walk along Lake Huron.</p> 
<p>“Because it’s raining, I’m drunk, cold, and don’t want to walk a mile.”</p>
<p>“Okay, well I don’t know who’s going to be able to drive us home,” I said “everyone has been drinking and we don’t even have our cars here.”</p>
<p>“Who can drive us home? It's less than a mile away!?” Mimi yelled to everyone in our vicinity. I turned and hid my face from the embarrassment that Mimi just allowed me to encounter, laughing to myself of her sometimes obnoxious behavior that I envy.</p> 
<p>“Austin can!” yelled Connor, who seems to suffer from similar obnoxious behavior. I locked eyes with the man that sat next to me for a moment, he gave me a half smile and shrugged his shoulders.</p> 
<p>“Who’s Austin?” Mimi asked Connor. 
<p>“Austin.” he said, motioning to the man that was standing to his left. 
<p>“Hi Austin! Can you drive us to the other side of the bridge?” Mimi asked Austin, he looked shocked,</p> 
<p>“Um- like St. Ignace?” he asked,</p> 
<p>“Oh my goodness, no sweetie, sorry, the otherside of the bridge, in Mackinaw City, like under the bridge… like a troll.” Mimi laughed at her joke that she stole from the bus driver she met when it was raining the other day.</p>
<p>“We live less than a mile away, just past the bridge.” I stated, trying to clear the confused look off Austin's face.</p> 
<p>“Oh, sure I can drive you guys.”</p> 
<p>Within 10 minutes, Mimi and I were racing to the burgundy Ram truck, since we said shotgun at the exact same time, it was fair game. Unfortunately, I lost – due to Mimi grabbing my purse that was slowly falling off my shoulder and throwing it behind me – getting stuck in the back, with the biggest first world problem to a drunk, cold, wet, girl; no heated seats.</p>
<p>When we got home, Mimi and I didn’t even make it through the door before I received a notification from Snapchat that someone new added me. It was Austin, I questioned Mimi on how he got my Snapchat and she bluntly said.</p> 
<p>“He was eyeing you all night but seemed too scared to make a move, so I just did it for him” I laughed, adding him back. Within a few moments, I received my first message from him:</p>
	<p>A- Hey, It was nice meeting you tonight, I hope you had a fun night.</p>
	<p>C- Hey! You too! Thanks for the ride again!</p> 
	<p>A- Anytime. What’re you up to later this week?</p> 
	<p>C- Work - I only get one day off a week.</p> 
	<p>A- oh, that sucks, would you want to go out and see a movie after work one day this week?</p> 
<p>“Mimi!” I yelled, waking her up from her drunken slumber.</p> 
<p>“What?!” She flinched, sitting up immediately as if she needed to evacuate the building.</p> 
<p>“Austin just asked me on a date.” I said, unable to process what to respond with.</p> 
<p>“I told you he was interested.” she said, laying her head back down on her pillow.</p> 
<p>“Ok… but like, I don’t know him very well, is that even safe?” I asked, confused on how I am supposed to ensure my safety now that my overly strict mother is unable to do so for me.</p> 
<p>“It’s so safe, we know where he works,” she said. After consideration, I texted him back, and put in my calendar out date for Friday night.</p> 
<p>After Mimi and I’s night out, Austin continued to make it apparent that he is interested in me, flirting with me over the course of the next few days over text, and on the dock when I would wait for the ferry. Our date on Friday finally came around, we went to a movie that neither of us knew anything about, and it ended up being a sequel to a movie that neither of us saw. After the movie, I was a little disappointed that our date wasn’t successful since we sat in a dark theatre, watching a movie we didn't understand. After the movie, we walked around Cheboygan, the closest town to Mackinaw City with a Walmart.</p>
<p>“Now what do you want to do?” Austin asked, as if our date wasn’t over.</p> 
<p>“Um.. I mean, I’m down for anything.” I said.</p> 
<P>“Okay, what about Ice cream?” he asked, I agreed. We decided to take our ice cream to the beach that was within walking distance to watch the sunset.</p>
<p>“We should go swimming” I said, getting excited about the possibilities the night may bring.</p>
<P>“I don’t have a bathing suit though,” Austin said, laughing awkwardly.</p> 
<P>“Either do I, we could run to my apartment and I could see if Mimi or Sonia have any extra suits.” I suggested since Mimi and Sonia both have boyfriends that have stayed at their apartments. Austin hesitantly agreed, and we headed to my apartment. Mimi didn’t have anything and Sonia wasn’t home, so Austin said he would just go in what he had on; I grabbed extra towels so that his driver and passenger heated seats didn’t get ruined after our swim, as well as a bathing suit for myself. A year prior to this outing, had you told me I was out after dark, in a town’s name I can’t pronounce, with a boy that I just met a few days ago, I would have told you that you were a lunatic. My parents limited my freedom, while I can now put into perspective the freedom I have without them, I felt exhilarated.</p>
<p>Freedom: The self power one has to do what one wants, imagines, or thinks without backlash, or restraint from others - since there is now no higher power.</p>
<p>We arrived back where we began watching the sunset, where we used to be able to see the bridge in the distance, now a glimmer of lights, gleaming across the lake. We ran into the water together, and almost immediately ran out due to Lake Huron being lower than 50℉. Once we got back into Austin’s truck, we could not stop laughing hysterically; everything on this date seemed like it was going wrong, but the chaos felt so perfect. Austin had the bright idea to go back to Mackinaw City, and see if Lake Michigan was warmer; he muttered on some nonsense about how the straits cause a current that is pushed towards Cheboygan, causing Lake Michigan to be ~10℉ warmer. Even though midnight was approaching and I had to work the next morning, I couldn’t resist the temptation that had no consequences.</p>

<p>~	~	~</p>

<p>The 4th of July had passed, and as any Island worker knows, the fun for a seasonal worker is the day or two after the holiday; when the tourists are hungover or headed home; making this day, the 5th of July. After getting off of work I rode the ferry back to the mainland alone, Katie and I’s routine broke a bit after Austin and I started dating. He almost always got off work upon my arrival to the mainland, creating the convenience of a ride wherever we decided to hang out, since he didn’t need to pay for parking. Austin and I both had the 6th off, and he had been texting me all day saying he wants to hang out with his coworkers, so once I arrived it was not a shock that Austin boyishly asked me to be his date to their party.</p> 
<p>“Potentially, what is the plan?” I asked.</p> 
<p>“Drink, maybe a fire, maybe a late night dip, who knows where the night will take us.” Austin said, I agreed, feeling like missing a night out with him may cause FOMO that would be the death of me. Austin drove me to my apartment so I could get changed and grab a bag of stuff to bring to the beach house in case our activities for the night took us somewhere unexpected. We then went to the liquor store, got some drinks, went to Austin’s house, in Cheboygan, so he could change and get a bag of items, and then made our way to the beach house. When we walked into the beach house, I walked in behind Austin, and the room was filled with 4 men that all had sheplers uniforms on. According to their name tags, all three of the Connors were there - yes, three - along with Josh, and Sonia. Austin introduced me to the new Connor’s that I had not met, them being confused with my uncommon name, while the three men that look almost identical, with the exact same name, all stand shoulder to shoulder.</p>
<p>“We’re going to go jump off the icebreaker,” the Connor that I met the night of the party said.</p>
<p>“That sounds illegal,” Austin responded.</p>
<p>“Hey, only if you get caught,” the Connor with slightly longer hair, and slightly skinner said.</p>
<P>“That’s true,” Austin said “Still sounds a bit sketchy.”</p>
<p>“No, we already scooped it out, they leave it unlocked overnight,” Josh said.</p>
<p>“Guys, I don’t think it’s a good idea,” Austin said hesitantly.</p> 
<p>“I think it sounds fun,” I said as I sipped my drink.</p>
<p>“Hey, Austin! Grow a pair bigger than your girls and maybe you’ll be able to come with us” one of the Connors said and they all laughed.</p>
<p>“Fine, we can go,” Austin said, smiling, shaking his head at me.</p>
<p>The seven of us began to make our way outside to the bikes parked out front a few hours after the sunset, luckily I brought a bathing suit in my bag so I was able to change. We rode our bikes 2-3 minutes in the opposite direction of my apartment, the humid, yet crisp Michigan air filled my lungs. A typical summer night in Northern Michigan would usually be pretty chilly, but this summer in particular was one of the hottest summers to date. Once we got to the giant boat docked to the right of the Shepler’s ferry dock, we walked onto the tourist trap that I had yet to visit, and made our way to the bow where we were planning on jumping off.</p> 
<p>Mackinac Island is a tourist destination that is like any other in the way that it hoaxes its tourists for capital. The trap itself is the entire island; the $35/per ferry ticket is the first bite, the second is the appeal of being on an island with no practical means of transportation; the appeal of seeing a place with no motor vehicles in sight is somewhat magical, forcing tourists to pay the $10/per person carriage taxi fee, or the $17/per hour bikes that many people can’t ride up the steep hills throughout Mackinac. Some tourists underestimate the cost of the Island, and then get stuck within the new tourist monopoly of Mackinaw City that presents itself as a small town with cheap(er) prices that are still 20% more expensive than they would be in a small city. Without gaining the whole experience of Mackinac Island, the City still poses a huge destination for tourists to lose money.</p>
<p>“Are we sure this is deep enough?” I asked, beginning to regret my momentary adventurous side. I rarely did anything adventurous my entire life up until this summer, but I don’t want to accidentally die because I’m trying to prove a point to my strict mother. The water looked black because of how dark it was outside, I couldn’t tell how far away it was, having no judgment on how deep it was.</p>
<p>“Yes, we jumped off it last week,” Josh said.</p>
<p>“Cool,” I said, feeling a bit less anxious, until I looked down, feeling my heart pounding against my chest yet again. I had to change my shoes since my sandals weren’t waterproof and the beaches in the straits of Mackinac are rocks instead of sand, I needed shoes on for when I got out of the water after jumping otherwise my feet would get cut up. I turned my flashlight on my watch since it was so dark, I could not see to put different shoes on.</p>
<p>Looking down at the water that the guys said is 50 feet away, Connor and Connor jumped first and swam to the shore, so now I am positive I’m not going to die. Austin stepped over the short fence on the bow, reaching back to help me do the same. We held hands and Austin counted before we jumped. </p>
<p>“1, 2… 3!” he yelled, jumping, and pulling me off with him. </p>
