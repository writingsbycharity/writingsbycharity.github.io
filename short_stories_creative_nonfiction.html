	Charity Williams 
	Finally, a breath of fresh air, a release of freedom. My parents left and began their 4.5-hour drive back home. I finally got out, for the last few years I could not wait to get out of my hometown, and now that it’s finally here, it is slightly underwhelming. After last summer, I have had an itch to get out of my hometown and my parent’s house. 2020 and covid was extremely draining and helped blossom my hatred for Kalamazoo, Michigan. I decided it would be best to unpack my things and begin organizing them but my roommate I had yet to meet was not home yet, and I did not want to intrude in her space. I started by putting my clothes away and making my bed.  While putting my bathroom items away, I heard the front door of my new apartment open, and in stepped a small young woman in a jean jacket and a long black dress with small flowers all over it. There was a smile plastered across her face as she squealed, 
	“Oh my goodness! You must be Charity!” she said with a level of enthusiasm I did not have. 
	“Hi!” I said, “Yes I am, you must be Molly” 
	“Oh no darling, call me Mimi please,” she said with an accent I couldn’t quite pinpoint. 
	“Oh yeah of course” I stated. Mimi began looking around the apartment, she walked into our shared bedroom and complimented my sheets. The room was a mess… not because of me, but because of all of Mimi’s dirty clothes, filthy cups, used plates, hangers, and two bins open, one laying on its side with knick-knacks spilling out of it. I tried to ignore it and complimented her decorations to distract from the disaster of a room I now called home. Mimi moved into the apartment about a month ago, she was able to start working on the island much sooner than me because I had to finish my semester at community college. The day was May 15th, three days before I started work, three days to get my shit together. 
	The summer job that I had lined up was quite interesting. It was located on Mackinac Island, which is a small Island located between the upper and lower peninsula of Michigan. Something cool about this Island though is that there are no cars, just horses and bikes, the island itself is only 3.5 miles big. As if that wasn’t a big enough tourist attraction, the Island is also known for its fudge, having around thirteen fudge shops, and I was going to work at one of them. 
	I realized that I needed to go grocery shopping soon, and I thought it would be a great opportunity to get to know my roommate just a little bit better. 
	“Do you want to go grocery shopping with me sometime tonight?” I asked Mimi 
	“Yes! I need to go shopping so bad, I’m pretty much free the rest of the night” 
“Awesome, I’m ready if you want to go now” I stated. 
“Yes!” Mimi said, “I love Walmart runs” 
“Oh, I’m not a fan of Walmart, I was hoping we could go to Target or Meijer,” I said, Mimi began giggling. “What?” I asked. 
“Sweetie, we’re in the middle of nowhere,” she said “The closest Target is like over two hours away, and the closest Meijer is like an hour away”. 
“What, no. No way, the only grocery store in Mackinaw is Walmart?” I asked 
“Well, no, there isn’t actually a Walmart in Mackinaw City,” she said “The closest one is in Cheboygan, it’s about 25 minutes away, there’s a small, expensive, family grocery store in Mackinaw.” I was baffled and filled with regret for not looking up nearby stores before moving there. 
 Mimi and I ended up getting to know each other well over the course of the next few days. She was a great help with getting to know the area since I had not been to Mackinaw City or Mackinac Island since I was 10. My first day of work finally rolled around, Memorial Day. I woke up a few hours early to begin getting ready. I packed my lunch, and an extra outfit, and stuffed it in my backpack. I grabbed my boat pass and made my way out to my bike which was locked up on the bike rack next to my car. I pedaled towards the boat dock for only 5 minutes, however, it was so hot I began to sweat. I was not super familiar with Northern Michigan summers, but I was under the impression that it never got super hot yet today it was around 80 degrees, getting hotter by the minute. I finally made it to the boat dock and into the commuter line to wait for the boat. Once the boat got there, I found my way to a seat in the back, closest to the door so I could get out first. I had an hour before work so I figured I could find a coffee shop, then find my work before my shift started. The boat ride was supposed to be 15 minutes long, so I had high hopes of being able to accomplish everything I wanted to. The boat was packed with tourists wearing masks. I could barely see out of the window that was facing the Mackinac Bridge because of all the people, but there it was, in all its glory, with traffic backed up on both sides. The bridge was gorgeous, everything about Mackinac is gorgeous. The boat ended up taking a toll and went under the bridge, causing our 15-minute boat ride to turn into a 30-minute one. Once the boat finally docked, I made my way down the main street, but could barely walk due to the high traffic. I walked around the main street for 15 minutes before I was able to find my new job. I finally walked in at 10:45, with no coffee in hand, and the overpowering smell of rich fudge filled my lunges. 
“Hello, Welcome in!” a young, short girl with long brown hair said to me from behind the counter. 
“Hi,” I said, “ I’m Charity, today is my first day” 
“Oh cool I’m Adena, I’ll go grab Heather,” she said as she went around the counter to the back of the fudge shop. As she was grabbing Heather I couldn’t help but look around the shop, the vinyl tiles are starting to turn yellow and are beginning to come up at the corners. The showcase of the fudge looks like it has been painted over at least 20 times, yet the white paint that is on top is chipping, showing a more yellow-toned white underneath it. There were two giant mirrors on the wall behind the display cases that looked as if they were 100 years old by how cloudy they were. Not to mention the overpowering scent of fudge that was filling my every breath making me more and more nauseous. 
“Hello!” I heard an over-ecstatic, yet monotone voice say from behind me. “I’m Heather,” she said, she put her hand out for me to shake. I have texted Heather periodically since she hired me, she has seemed pretty nice, but very quiet. 
“Hi!” I said as I shook her hand “I’m Charity” 
“We’re so excited you’re here!” she said “Today is supposed to be pretty busy, everyone that was getting unemployment money last year is finally ready to spend it. Adena will catch you up on everything you need to know” She handed me a white shirt and a blue apron and asked me to put them on, and showed me the way to the bathroom. The store is old, musty, and dirty. I should have done more research before I moved there. The bathroom was underneath a staircase so the ceiling was slanted. I walked in to change my clothes and whacked my head against the ceiling. Then, I sat down to go to the bathroom before going back out for my training, and again, whacked my head on the ceiling. I finally walked out, probably slightly concussed, ready to begin my training. Adena was waiting for me behind the counter, she explained the history of May’s Fudge Shop and the history of fudge on Mackinac Island. She then trained me on the register and how to wrap the fudge and candies. After about 20 minutes of training, I was ready. 
My first day at the Fudge shop was a success. It was supposedly one of the busiest days of the year, so it was very fast-paced for the first day. One of my co-workers, a candy maker, lived in the same apartment complex as me, so I waited for her to get done with her shift before I left the Island. Once Katie was done, we walked around Main Street for a while, until we finally made our way back to the boats. The entire boat ride back, Katie and I talked about how and why both of us were working at May’s Fudge Shop. After riding our bikes back to our apartment complex, we went our separate ways and I made my way into my own apartment. As soon as I walked in the door I was hit with a wave of perfume, and music. 
“Mimi?” I said
“Yes Sweetie!” she yelled from our bedroom. She was sitting in front of a mirror we bought from Walmart the other day, doing her makeup. “Get ready, we’re going to a party in an hour”
“Oh?” I said
“The Shepler boys are having a party, Sonia invited us”. Sonia is a girl who works with Mimi at the coffee shop. They have become pretty close, and she is dating one of the guys who works for Sheplers (The ferry company). After about 30 minutes Sonia came to our apartment to hang out with us while we got ready and walked with us to the party itself. 
We finally made it to the party at, what the boys call, “the beach house”. It’s a white, two-story house right next to the boat dock where the ferries take off. The outside looks pretty nice, but once we got inside it looked completely different with the oddest layout that I still don’t quite understand. The floors were very old, and the cabinets were missing some doors here and there, whereas the living room had grungy carpet that was hard as a rock in some spots and two old couches with stains all over them. Sonia’s boyfriend Josh, and his best friend Connor started playing the guitar for everyone. This tall, tan guy with a Shepler’s hat on sat next to me on the couch and tried to make small talk. I could barely hear him though and he was acting very awkward. Someone from the kitchen yelled in the living room 
“Hey Austin, think we can set off fireworks without the cops coming?”
“No!” the guy sitting next to me yelled back at them
“We’re going to do it anyway!” the unknown voice yelled back. 
“I better go help them,” he said as he got up and walked outside. Mimi came back into the living room and grabbed my hand, 
“Come on!” she said and she led me outside. We got outside and the boys were huddled in a circle trying to light a firework in the rain. Since this is statistically one of the hottest summers in Northern Michigan, the rain felt nice. They couldn’t get it lit, and finally, Austin yelled at them 
“Guys, you already had the cops come yesterday for lighting fireworks off, let’s just go back inside,” I began walking back inside, with Mimi trailing behind me, 
“We need to find a ride home,” Mimi said 
“What why?” I said
“Because it’s raining, I’m drunk, cold, and don’t want to walk a mile”
“Okay, well I don’t know who’s going to be able to drive us home,” I said. 
“Who can drive us home? It's less than a mile away!!!???” yelled Mimi. 
“Austin can!” yelled Connor and Josh. I looked at the man that attempted to flirt with me earlier and he gave me a half smile and shrugged his shoulders. He agreed to drive us home, Mimi and I ran to his car which he said was parked out front, we both called shotgun at the same time so whoever got there first got a shotgun. Mimi grabbed my purse that was falling off my arm and threw it behind us and started hysterically laughing. I got stuck in the back seat, which in reality is not a big deal. When we got home, Mimi and I didn’t even make it through the door before I received a notification from Snapchat that someone new added me. It was Austin, I questioned Mimi on how he got my Snapchat and she bluntly said 
“He was flirting with you all night but seemed too scared to make a move, so I just did it for him” I laughed and added him back. 
After Mimi and I’s night out, Austin made it apparent that he is interested in me, he continued to flirt with me over the course of the next few days over text, and on the dock when I would be waiting for the ferry. We went on our first date within a week of meeting each other, we went to a movie that neither of us knew anything about, and it ended up being a sequel to a movie that neither of us saw. Then we got ice cream, and went swimming in Lake Michigan at midnight, then drove ten minutes away to Lake Huron and swam again. It doesn’t sound that exciting or romantic, especially taking into consideration that we were 20 minutes late for the movie but, it was exhilarating. After living with my parents who had very strict restrictions on what I could do, it was like I was living a new life. After Austin and I’s first date, we saw each other every single day.  
 On July 5th I got off work and rode the ferry back to the mainland. Austin got off as soon as I walked off the Ferry. He explained how he wanted to hang out with his coworkers at the beach house, and how he wanted me to come. I asked what we would be doing with them, and he said that they wanted to drink and see where the night took them. So, that’s what we did. We went to the liquor store, got some drinks, and then made our way to the beach house. We walked into the beach house, I walked in behind Austin, all three of the Connors were there - yes, three -, Josh, and Sonia. All the boys started yelling and became very excited we made an appearance. 
“We’re going to go jump off the icebreaker,” Connor said 
“That sounds illegal” Austin responded 
“Hey, only if you get caught,” the other Connor said.
“That’s true,” he said “Still sounds a bit sketchy” 
“No, we already scooped it out, they leave it unlocked overnight,” Josh said 
“Guys, I don’t think it’s a good idea,” said Austin 
“I think it sounds fun,” I said as I sipped my drink. 
	“Hey, Austin! Grow a pair bigger than your girls and maybe you’ll be able to come with us” one of the Connors said and they all laughed. 
	“Fine, let’s go,” Austin said, smiling, shaking his head at me. We all began to make our way outside to the bikes parked out front, luckily I already had a bathing suit in Austin’s car so I quickly changed and we were on our way. Once we got to the giant boat located to the right of the Shepler’s ferry dock. We walked onto the boat and made our way to the bow where we were planning on jumping off. 
	“Are we sure this is deep enough?” I asked, beginning to regret my momentary adventurous side. I just discovered this side of myself though, I was raised as an only child with a very strict mom. I rarely did anything adventurous my entire life up until this summer, but I don’t want to accidentally die because I’m trying to prove a point. The water looked black because of how dark it was outside, I couldn’t tell how far away the water was, and I had no judgment on how deep it was. 
	“Yes, we jumped off it last week,” Josh said. 
	“Cool,” I said, looking down at the water that the guys said is 50 feet away. Connor and Connor jumped first and swam to the shore, so now I am positive I’m not going to die. Austin stepped over the short fence on the bow, reaching back to help me do the same. We held hands and Austin counted before we jumped.
	“1… 2… 3!” he yelled, as we both jumped, I plugged my nose and tucked my knees to my chest. Once I hit the water it felt like I was breaking through ice. I lost Austin’s hand at some point, I swam to the surface and looked around. Austin was laughing hysterically, it was contagious, I began laughing too. We both swam to the shore and made our way back up to the bow of the boat to grab all our things. 
	“My Apple watch is missing” I stated I turned the flashlight on my phone and started looking around. The boys got on their bikes and searched our last steps to see if they could find it. 
	“Where is the last place you had it” Austin asked 
	“I-I don’t know,” I said, “I think I had it on when I jumped in” 
	“It’s fine, we’ll go diving for it tomorrow,” said Connor. 
We all got back on our bikes and rode back to the beach house, where we hung out and dwelled on our adventure and the lost watch. The boys went searching for it the next day but didn’t have any luck. It was disappointing because I had started tracking my steps and using my watch a lot more, but it’s a first-world problem. Austin and I hung out with the boys and Sonia for the rest of the night, and Austin and I ended up walking home later. 
	Throughout the summer Austin and I avoided the conversation of if we were just a summer fling, or if we wanted to try long-distance. I needed to go back to Kalamazoo for school, and Austin had a career up north. When August finally rolled around, I was starting to reminisce about the good times I had over the summer, and I began my countdown. One night Austin and I went swimming in our usual spot on a secluded beach on Lake Michigan. I brought up what may happen once I leave to go home, he was extremely reluctant to discuss it, but I finally made some progress. 
	“Charity, I love you, obviously I don’t want to just stop seeing you” 
	“Yeah, but do you think that it could actually work?” I asked. 
	“I think if we try hard enough, then yes.” He said. It gave me a little bit of hope, we planned to see each other at least once a month, and to Facetime every day. Up until the day I moved, Austin and I spent everyday together, and we had many bonfires with my coworkers, his coworkers, and obviously Mimi. It was a magical summer that I would relive a million times if I could.

	“Swimmers on your mark, set… GO!” 
The anthem of my childhood. 
	I was raised by two loving parents that happened to have me at 18. For the first few years of my life, I lived at my dad’s parent’s house, but quite often I ended up at my mom’s parent’s house which was conveniently less than a mile away. When I was around a year old my parents built a house that was again, conveniently less than a mile away from both their parent’s houses, when they say it takes a village… it really does. My dad’s parent’s house had a pool, so obviously when I was a toddler in the summer we spent the majority of our days by the pool, regardless of who was watching me. The pool quickly became my favorite place, so much so that whenever someone would be holding me to ensure I wouldn’t drown, I would yell at them to “put me down”. At two years old, my mom decided to enroll me in swim lessons. She said it was necessary because she didn’t trust me around the pool since I tried escaping the house to get in the pool, alone, multiple times. Swim lessons went well, and within a few months, I had already picked up enough skills to stay afloat without any assistance. Throughout the next year, I kept going to swim lessons until I graduated. I was very disappointed to graduate from swim lessons, I wasn’t able to swim every week anymore. I asked my parents about going to swim class again for the majority of the winter until they finally caved in and asked the club that taught me how to swim if they had anything I could participate in. The next week, I was back in the pool, but now I was on a swim team.
	When I joined the swim team at the club, they warned my parents that they might have to pull me off the team since I was the youngest kid on the team by far. I was four years old, swimming with six and seven-year-olds. They were worried that I wouldn’t be able to keep up. They were right, at first it was hard to swim at the same level as a lot of the kids, but they were also wrong because after a few months of training, I was swimming circles around the other kids. That may be a bit of an exaggeration, I wasn’t swimming circles around all the other kids, but some. I was doing well enough that my coach wanted me to compete in the swim meet that the club was hosting. My parents were extremely proud of me, they weren’t able to watch my swim practices, so they didn’t know quite how much I had improved. 
	The swim meet finally came around a month later. I had been training twice a week, perfecting my freestyle and backstroke, since those were the two strokes I was competing in. When I woke up the morning of the swim meet, I ran into my parent’s room and jumped on their bed to wake them up. 
	“It’s swim meet day!” I yelled jumping up and down on the fluffy bed, occasionally stepping on a hard limb instead. 
	“Charity! Quit it!” my mom yelled, I plopped down onto the bed, in between my parents’ criss-cross applesauce. 
	“How many minutes until we can go to the pool?” I asked 
	“A lot” my dad mumbled into the pillow. 
	“It’s at 3:00 pm, and right now it’s 8:00 am,” my mom said “So that means you have to wait five hours, and how many minutes are in an hour?” 
	“Fifty,” I said confidently 
	“Close, sixty” my mom said 
	“So how many episodes of SpongeBob do I watch before we can leave?” I asked 
	“You’re not going to watch SpongeBob all day,” my mom said. At this point in my childhood, time confused me tremendously. After school, the school bus would drop me off at my grandma’s house, where I would have to watch three, sometimes four, episodes of SpongeBob before she was ready to play with me, which is an average of about 45 minutes. So, I usually used SpongeBob episodes as a description of time, even if I didn’t want to watch SpongeBob. 
	The day went by slowly, I ate breakfast, played, ate lunch, fell asleep watching cartoons with my dad, woke up, ate a snack, and then… Finally started getting ready for my swim meet. I changed into my swimsuit in the locker room of the club with my mom, she then held a piece of pink silicone in her hands. 
	“What is that?” I asked pointing to her hands
	“Oh, it’s your swim cap” 
	“What’s a swim cap?” I asked 
	“It keeps your hair out of your face while you swim,” she said
	“Oh…” I thought about how that piece of pink silicone was going to get on my head and I couldn’t figure it out “How?” 
	“I’ll show you,” she said standing behind me, gathering all my hair into a messy bun. She then put the pink silicone over my blonde hair that was sitting on top of my head. She started stretching the cap and it hurt, like really bad. 
	“OW!” I yelled 
	“Oh, I’m sorry,” my mom said, removing the swim cap. 
	“I don’t want to wear that thing,” I said pouting. 
	“Well, coach said you can’t swim without it,” 
	“Oh, okay, try it again but don’t pull my hair.” 
	“Okay, maybe flip your head upside down,” she said, so I did what she asked, she put the swim cap overtop of my bun again and tried pulling it around the rest of my hair. 
	“OW!” I yelled again, but she kept pulling “OW! OW! MOMMY STOP!”
	“Sorry, sorry, sorry, you’ll be fine,” she said, still pulling the cap. I lifted my head up and looked in the mirror, it was pulling my eyes back, and I had no hair anymore. 
	“That hurt!” I angrily said to my mom. She started laughing slightly
	“Your face looks funny,” she said 
	“Your face looks funny!” I yelled back at her. After fighting with the swim cap, we walked onto the pool deck and found my dad. 
	“Are you ready?” my dad asked me 
	“Yes!” I said excitedly. We were on the opposite side of the pool than the rest of my team and my coach, there were a bunch of chairs lined up, and parents were filling them. 
	“Okay, Charity Ann, why don’t you go ahead and find your coach?” my mom said to me. I looked to the other side of the pool where my coach was sitting with the team and began making my way over there. I sat down on the ground next to a little girl who looked familiar. I didn’t know anyone from my team since swimming is such an individual sport. My coach was talking to the team, and she explained that she was going to tell us when our turn was next, and that we couldn’t get in the pool until it was our turn. The first heat began with a man talking through a microphone, 
	“100 free relay. Event 1. Heat 1. Swimmers on your mark… set…” BEEP! A very loud beep 
Launched its sound, bouncing off the walls of the pool deck, and echoing throughout. I practically jumped out of my skin and looked around the pool, my eyes started watering and I ran across the pool deck to my mom. She had her arms open and ready for me, I sat on her lap and cried as she rubbed my back. 
	“Did that scare you?” she asked me, I nodded my head. “Okay, well it’s going to happen again,” she said 
	“Event 1. Heat 2.” 
	“Cover your ears,” she said. I grabbed my ears so fast. 
“Swimmers on your mark… set…” BEEP! It wasn’t as bad with my ears covered but it was still very loud. My coach came over to me and my parents 
“Hey,” she said “What happened?” she asked, referring to the tears streaming down my face. 
“Someone wasn’t prepared for the loud beep,” my mom said. 
“Oh, I get scared sometimes when I hear loud noises too,” she said “This noise is not too scary when you’re ready for it though” 
“It’s still scary,” I said and she giggled
“Okay, do you still want to swim?” she asked me, I nodded my head yes. “Okay, well you’re up soon, do you want to come sit with me?” I nodded my head yes, she grabbed my hand and led me to the rest of the team. She then started calling names for people to line up behind her and I was one of them. “Okay, Charity, you’re in lane two,” she said as she dropped me off at the lane. “You can jump in now, and wait until you hear that really loud beep to push off, this is freestyle okay?” 
“Okay,” I said back to her. I jumped in the pool and waited for the beep. I was so excited to show my parents how good of a swimmer I have become since I started. I looked to both of my sides, and a girl from my team was in lane one, and another girl with a crocodile on her swim cap was in lane three. 
“50 yards free. Event 2. Heat 1. Swimmers on your mark….” BEEP! I pushed off the wall as hard as I could and began gliding through the water. I stared at my hands the whole time I swam, watching the bubbles that were being created around my fingers. I could hear muffled screaming from under the water, I couldn’t hear anyone though, I couldn’t tell who was cheering, and if they were even cheering for me. I hit the wall as hard as I could with my arm and looked to both of my sides, the girl in lane one wasn’t done swimming yet, and the girl in lane three wasn’t there either, nobody in any of the lanes were done yet. I looked across the pool at my parents and my dad was whistling and clapping his hands, and my mom was screaming and clapping. I climbed out of the pool and my coach was waiting for me, 
	“You continue to amaze me! You did amazing!” she said 
	“Thank you,” I said with a smile stretching from ear to ear. My mom and dad came over to me, hugged me, and told me good job.
After the meet, my parents were talking to this guy on the pool deck, he was shorter than my dad, bald, and kind of chubby. I made my way over to my parents, and my dad introduced me to 
“Coach Parker - he wants you to join his swim team, they have a lot more swim meets and practices, he saw how fast you were” 
“Hi Coach Parker,” I said 
“Hi sweetie,” he said back to me “You’re pretty fast in the pool,” I nodded my head.
After we got into the car, my parents explained to me that Coach Parker was trying to recruit me for his swim team because of how fast I was at such a young age. I couldn’t quite understand, but I knew that joining his team meant I got to swim more, and I knew I wanted to swim as much as possible, so, of course, I said yes to switching teams.
