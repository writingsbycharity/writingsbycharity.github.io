<p>I stare at the freckles that are faded without a summer glow. I think the lack of melanin changes the shade of my eyes; their usual ocean blue is turned to a murky deep blue. The bags under my eyes are screaming for attention, I add some green color corrector to contrast the purple that is taking over under my eyeballs. As I allow the correction to take place, I begin curling my mid-length, chestnut hair.</p> 
<p>Tonight is my ten year highschool reunion, I haven’t seen these people in years. I want them to see me and think that I look happier, more successful, and put together. I don’t want anyone to see me and think I fell off my rocker. I also don’t want anyone to think I look aged.</p> 
<p>Between sections of curling my hair, I blend the corrector into my noticeable bags, hoping for the best. I take a break from my hair and continue my makeup. I apply the neutral peach to my flush face and begin painting my canvas. I’m nervous that everyone will see right through me. They need to think nothing has changed since they last saw me. I grab a lighter shade concealer and begin trying to cover up the discolored unevenness that inhabit my cheeks. The blush undertones of my nervousness shine through the thin layer applied; anymore, and everyone will notice that my face looked fake. I deal with the discoloration.</p> 
<p>I move onto trying to hide the double chin that I began to develop after I turned twenty-five. I grab my bronzer and brush and begin painting once again, creating shadows where there are normally highlights. I do the same to my nose, faking the button that sits on top, and adding some highlighter, to really make it pop. I can’t tell if any of this is actually making me look the same. I continue anyway, I curl my eyelashes that have grown back slightly, from when they all got pulled out from my old eyelash curler. I then sweep mascara onto my eyelashes, trying to create non-existent volume. My eyelashes do not look the same. There's still a small section that looks bare on my right eye, and the eyelashes that are there are half the length as the ones that reside on my left eye. I apply puffy white glue on the edge of the fake lashes that I held between my index finger and thumb, waiting a minute for it to get tacky before finalizing my face.</p>
<p>I finish up the last section of curls I have left, wrapping each strand of hair around the iron. I examine my face, it doesn’t look the same. It looks aged, it looks layered. I finish my hair with a clip on the side, and make my way to the reunion. I feel like they’re all going to notice the added weight, the wrinkle on my forehead, the bags under my eyes, and they’re going to think I am an old, ugly failure. I don’t know what to say when they ask what I do for work, my job is boring and I do not make a wage that I can brag about.</p> 
<p>As I arrive, I walk through the gymnasium entrance of my old highschool, and I am greeted with a warm smile from a familiar face.</p> 
<p>They say, “you look stunning!”</p>
